       <p>National liberation, national renaissance, the restoration of nationhood to thepeople, commonwealth: whatever may be the headings used or the new formulasintroduced, decolonization is always a violent phenomenon. At whatever level westudy  it—relationships  between  individuals,  new  names  for  sports  clubs,  thehuman admixture at cocktail parties, in the police, on the directing boards of na-tional or private banks—decolonization is quite simply the replacing of a certain‘‘species’’ of men by another ‘‘species’’ of men. Without any period of transition,there  is  a  total,  complete,  and  absolute  substitution.   </p>
    

    <br>
    <p>It  is  true  that  we  couldequally well stress the rise of a new nation, the setting up of a new state, its diplo-matic  relations,  and  its  economic  and  political  trends.  But  we  have  preciselychosen to speak of that kind of tabula rasa which characterizes at the outset alldecolonization. Its unusual importance is that it constitutes, from the very firstday, the minimum demands of the colonized. To tell the truth, the proof of suc-cess lies in a whole social structure being changed from the bottom up. The extra-ordinary importance of this change is that it is willed, called for, demanded. Theneed for this change exists in its crude state, impetuous and compelling, in theconsciousness and in the lives of the men and women who are colonized. But thepossibility of this change is equally experienced in the form of a terrifying futurein the consciousness of another ‘‘species’’ of men and women: the colonizers.Decolonization,  which  sets  out  to  change  the  order  of  the  world,  is,  ob-viously,  a  program  of  complete  disorder. .</p>

    <br>
    <p> But  it  cannot  come  as  a  result  ofmagical  practices,  nor  of  a  natural  shock,  nor  of  a  friendly  understanding.Decolonization, as we know, is a historical process: that is to say that it cannot beunderstood, it cannot become intelligible nor clear to itself except in the exactmeasure that we can discern the movements which give it historical form andcontent. Decolonization is the meeting of two forces, opposed to each other bytheir very nature, which in fact owe their originality to that sort of substantifica-tion which results from and is nourished by the situation in the colonies. Theirfirst encounter was marked by violence and their existence together—that is tosay the exploitation of the native by the settler—was carried on by dint of a greatarray of bayonets and cannons. The settler and the native are old acquaintances.In fact, the settler is right when he speaks of knowing ‘‘them’’ well</p>
